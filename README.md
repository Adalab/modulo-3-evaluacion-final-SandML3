# React module final exercise: Harry Potter characters finder.

This exercise has been done as part of the final exam of the React module in Adalab.

# Project description.

In this exercise we have created a web page to search for Harry Potter characters.
When the page loads, a list appears with characters from gryffindor house preselected. It offers the possibility of display the characters of all the houses, sorting them alphabetically, filtering by gender and / or by name.
When the user clicks on one of them, they can see a new page with details about the person who was clicked on.

For this we have used HTML5 markup language, to which we have applied some styles with CSS3 and we have developed the functionality through JavaScript and React.

To develop this project we have used one single branch which contains the stable version.

The result is published on GitHub Pages and you can see it [here](http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-SandML3/). I hope you like it!
